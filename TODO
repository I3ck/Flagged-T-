reverse sorted
each class its own .h, but a merging .h file (as in cppOpt) ? (only if file becomes too big)
more tests
define more combined types
custom sorting predicate ?
inheritance can improve this e.g. Positive is a NonZero, as well as Negative etc.

rename make_xyz to make() since the type is already well-defined

proper hierarchy Positive is NonZero, Negative is NonZero, all are NonNull.
